Quick server script for visualizing and marking mesh renders for data cleanup. Put all the renders in the `static/renders` directory and launch the server. Go to `<server>/0/0` and use arrow keys to move around or mark bad samples. Name of bad samples will be stored in `static/bad.txt`. Samples in `static/renders` folder are named as `{samplename}_{subindex}.ext`. Example of renders is provided in `static/renders`.
